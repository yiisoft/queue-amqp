            Can't explicitly set channel name when an exchange is declared.

            Probably, you have called QueueFactory::get() without explicit configuration
            for a given channel.
            Your QueueProvider configuration has an exchange,
            which can't be implicitly binded to a new queue due to differences in behaviors
            of different types of exchanges. Please, create an explicit configuration
            with a fully-configured adapter for the channel you are trying to create.
